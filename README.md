## Visit the Code

This project has two main folders:

* **`client/`** – contains the React frontend code
* **`server/`** – contains the Node.js + Express backend code

To explore the code or make changes:

* Open `client/` for all React files like components, pages, and routes
* Open `server/` for backend code including APIs, models, and authentication logic
